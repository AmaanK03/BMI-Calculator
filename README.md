# BMI Calculator

## Overview
The BMI Calculator is a tool designed to calculate and display your Body Mass Index (BMI). BMI is a simple metric that helps assess whether you have a healthy body weight for your height. This tool is useful for monitoring your weight management and overall health.

## Features
- **Easy-to-Use Interface:** Input your height and weight to quickly calculate your BMI.

- **Health Categories:** Provides a classification based on your BMI (e.g., Underweight, Normal weight, Overweight, Obesity).

## How to Use
1. **Input Your Height:** Enter your height in centimeters or meters.
2. **Input Your Weight:** Enter your weight in kilograms.
3. **View Results:** The calculator will display your BMI and the associated health category.

## Example
- **Height:** 170 cm
- **Weight:** 70 kg
- **BMI Calculation:** BMI = Weight (kg) / (Height (m) x Height (m))
- **Result:** Your BMI is 24.2, which falls into the 'Normal weight' category.

## Limitations of BMI
Although BMI is a widely used and useful indicator of healthy body weight, it does have its limitations. BMI is only an estimate that cannot take body composition into account. Due to the wide variety of body types as well as the distribution of muscle, bone mass, and fat, BMI should be considered along with other measurements rather than being used as the sole method for determining a person's healthy body weight.
